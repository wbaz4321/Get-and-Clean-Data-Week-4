# Get-and-Clean-Data-Week-4
# Breif of the scripts
Initially, the scripts load in a useful package, i.e. dplyr, also reshape2 is loaded in case it will be needed

First step is load in all the train and test data sets, using "read.table()" function. At the same time, variables names and activity labels are also loaded in using the same function

Second, the names are extracted from the "feature" file and "" is applied to choose only features that contain mean or std values. Here "grep()" function comnbined with regular expression is used during searching.

Third, use "cbind()" function to combine suject, activity and the 66 variables in test and train dataset, named as "test_df" and "train_df" respectively. Then, call "cbind()" again to combine these 2 newly developed data frames to form the integrated dataset required by this practice, named as "df".

Create a function called "setActivity()" to label the 6 activities based on the number 1-6, taking use of "which()" function.

Use "group_by()" to group "df" by subject and activity, which results in 180 different groups (6x30).

Use "summarise_if()" or "summarise_at()" function to build a new tidy dataset based on selected columns to show the average value of each variable of each subject and each type of activity. Note in the scripts, "summarise_if()" is used. Therefore a logical vector should be generated first, which is sent to the function as a parameter.

# Code book of the scripts
train_x: a data frame that contains values of 561 variables of train data;

train_y: a vector that contains the returned activity value of train data;

train_sub: a vector that indicates the experiment subject of train data;

test_x: a data frame that contains values of 561 variables of test data;

test_y: a vector that contains the returned activity value of test data;

test_sub: a vector that indicates the experiment subject of test data;

feature: a data frame that contains the 561 features' names for both train and test data;

ini_names: character vector that contains the 561 features' names extracted from "feature";

t1: indexes in the "ini_names" to indicate the location of names that contain "mean"

t2: indexes in the "ini_names" to indicate the location of names that contain "std"

train_x_mean: selected columns in train_x according to t1

train_x_std: selected columns in train_x according to t2

test_x_mean: selected columns in test_x according to t1

test_x_std: selected columns in test_x according to t2

train_df: combined data frame of train_x, train_y and train_sub;

test_df: combined data frame of test_x, test_y and test_sub;

df: combined dataset of train_df and test_df;

input: temporary variable by extracting "activity" from "df";

setActivity: function used to assign activity labels;

df_group: a data frame generated by grouping "df";

create_tidy: a function used to create a logical vector for "summarise_if()" function;

tidy_df: tidy data frame that show average values of each variable of each group according to "df_group";
